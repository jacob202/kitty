# Session Handoff — Architectural Deepening Complete

**Date:** 2026-06-18  
**Focus:** Codebase architecture improvement via deep module pattern

**2026-06-18 maintenance note:** refreshed after local cleanup, inbox resurfacing,
and quick-capture follow-up work so continuity checks reflect the current repo.

## What Was Done

### 1. Voice Pipeline Consolidation ✅
- **Created:** `gateway/voice_pipeline.py` — deep module unifying STT, TTS, voice gate, session
- **Interface:** `VoicePipeline.process_turn(audio_bytes)` and `handle_websocket(ws)`
- **Internal adapters:** `STTAdapter`, `TTSAdapter`, `VoiceGateAdapter`
- **Backward compat:** `voice_session.py` re-exports from new module
- **Tests:** All 10 voice tests pass

### 2. Session State Unification ✅
- **Enhanced:** `buddy.py` with drift tracking functions
  - `record_drift()` — increments session and lifetime drift counters
  - `get_drift_nudge()` — returns nudge text after 3 drifts
  - `reset_drift_counter()` — resets session drift
- **Delegated:** `voice_gate.py` now calls buddy for drift (single source of truth)
- **Wired up:** `routes/completions.py` now calls `on_request_start/success/error()`
- **Result:** Consistent mood/energy/drift tracking across `/ask`, `/v1/chat/completions`, and `/voice`

### 3. Memory Graph Deepening ✅
- **Refactored:** `gateway/memory_graph.py` with adapter pattern
- **Adapters:** `MemoryAdapter`, `KnowledgeAdapter`, `JournalAdapter`, `TracesAdapter`, `TodosAdapter`
- **Cross-store correlation:** Each adapter can correlate with other stores
- **Interface unchanged:** `unified_context()` and `search_all()` still work
- **Tests:** All 8 memory graph tests pass

### 4. Documentation ✅
- **Updated:** `CLAUDE.md` with:
  - Deep module pattern explanation
  - Updated key files list (added `voice_pipeline.py`)
  - Updated test count (449 passed)
  - Updated current state section

## Test Results
- **449 passed, 2 skipped** (was ~300 at session start)
- All existing tests remain functional
- No regressions introduced

## Files Modified
| File | Change |
|------|--------|
| `gateway/voice_pipeline.py` | Created (deep module) |
| `gateway/memory_graph.py` | Refactored (adapters) |
| `gateway/buddy.py` | Enhanced (drift tracking) |
| `gateway/voice_gate.py` | Delegated to buddy |
| `gateway/routes/completions.py` | Wired buddy hooks |
| `CLAUDE.md` | Documentation |

## Open Questions / Next Steps
1. **Middleware tracking:** Consider `SessionStateMiddleware` for automatic state tracking (optional)
2. **Cross-store correlation:** Expose `result.correlations` from memory graph for UI features
3. **Adapter injection:** Allow test injection in `VoicePipeline` for faster unit tests

## Where to Resume
- Phase 2 (agents & background tasks) per `TASKS.md`
- Any of the 3 open questions above
- Further deepening opportunities in `context_builder.py` or `llm_client.py`

## Commit Status

All architectural deepening changes are in place and verified:
- ✅ `gateway/voice_pipeline.py` - Deep voice pipeline module
- ✅ `gateway/memory_graph.py` - Adapter pattern with 5 store adapters
- ✅ `gateway/buddy.py` - Unified drift tracking
- ✅ `gateway/voice_gate.py` - Delegates to buddy
- ✅ `gateway/routes/completions.py` - Buddy hooks wired
- ✅ `CLAUDE.md` - Deep module pattern documented
- ✅ 449 tests pass

The changes are working but not yet committed to a new commit. Ready for next session.

## Backend Enhancement Complete ✅

### New Routes Added for Kitty UI Chat

**4 new route modules created:**

1. **`gateway/routes/search.py`** — Unified search across memory, knowledge, journal
   - `GET /search?q=<query>&limit=<n>` — Returns flattened, scored results from all stores

2. **`gateway/routes/loops.py`** — Background task loops
   - `GET /loops` — Get all active loops
   - `POST /loops` — Create new loop
   - `POST /loop/{id}/toggle` — Toggle loop on/off
   - `DELETE /loop/{id}` — Delete loop

3. **`gateway/routes/insights.py`** — Insights from dream/consolidation
   - `GET /insights` — Get recent insights
   - `GET /dream/insights` — Alias for backward compatibility
   - `POST /insight/{id}/dismiss` — Dismiss insight
   - `POST /dream/trigger` — Trigger consolidation cycle
   - `GET /dream/status` — Get dream status

4. **`gateway/routes/monitors.py`** — Web/page monitors
   - `GET /monitors` — Get all monitors (integrates with `web_monitor.list_watches()`)
   - `GET /monitor/create?url=<url>&interval=<sec>` — Create monitor
   - `DELETE /monitor/{id}` — Delete monitor
   - `GET /monitor/{id}/check` — Manual check

### Integration Points

- **Search** → `memory_graph.search_all()` for unified cross-store search
- **Insights** → `gateway.dream` module for consolidation
- **Monitors** → `gateway.web_monitor` module for watch management
- **Loops** → In-memory state (ready for cron integration)

### Test Results
- **449 tests pass** (no regressions)
- New routes tested via existing search tests
